NEXT JS NOTES
- Next.JS is a framework for creating pre-rendered React websites.
This means that the React components are already rendered to HTMl 
pages before it reaches the browser after request.

- It results in better SEOs becuase the response from the server is 
a pre-rendered HTML page, this is called Server-Side Rendering.

- It makes the React app more paatable to the web crawlers.

- Routing in Next has been made easier. Next automatically creates a route
for every component created in the Pages folder.

- It is possible to have subfolders in the Pages folder and Next would still
create a route for every component created in the subfolders.

- Whenever there's a file named 'index', it creates a root path with it.

- In React, there are components that are reusable and are supposed to display
on every single page routed to. These components are not stored in the Pages 
folder of the Next js app. Create a new folder and store said components so that 
Next js does not automatically create a path for it.

- When linking pages in Next, we import the Link component from 'next/link' and wrap 
the <a> tags with the <Link> tags.

- The href attribute is placed in the Link tag.

- Next js does Code Splitting by default. This is the process of loading only the 
JS code needed for the page requested by the client.

-  When a Next app page is loaded, the server-side prefetches all the code for the links
on the present page so that when the client routes, the code will be ready and waiting 
for display in the browser.

- There  are component which the programmer would want to be in display
whatever page is routed to, like in React. This is achieved in Next by 
creating a Layout file in the folder containing all the other other unchanging
components and use its tag to wrap the components in the _app.js file.

- The two ways in which styling is done, global.css and css modules.

- The global.css file is already imported into the _app.js file which means
that every style put in the global file affects every component in the app.

- Individual styling is done with CSS modules.

- CSS modules are created with the .module keyword alongside the module name when 
naming the file.

- The styles in them are imported in the component the programmer desires to use them.
The one good thing about it is that if a class is used in many components, they are not 
actually of the same class and modfications to one will not affect the rest.

- In css modules, all the selectors must be classes.

- Next js has defualt 404 pages. There is no need to link it to anything
the components for 404s are named '404'. It is a special name, like the 'index' file 
which tells Next that this is a catch-all, meaning that a non-exisitng url will 
prompt this page to load like in React.

- Redirecting users in Next is very much the same as in React expect instead of 
useHistory(), we use the useRouter package that comes with Next.

- useRouter contains all the methods that useHistory does so it is a very slight 
transition.

- When using images in your Next app, save all the images in the Public folder and they
will be used in any component by using their names in the src attibute of the image tag.

- In Next v10, there is an Image component that comes with the Next packages that can be used 
for images in your app. they must be used with width and height attributes.

- It only loads the images when the browser scrolls to the point it is programmed to (laser-loading)
 show. This helps with optimization for loading speed.

- The Title tag in HTML is used to name the files a user visits. The names are displayed in the tab 
that shows in a browser. In Next, these names can be changed according to the pages a user visits with
the help of the Head component in Next.

- It is imported into the component from next an used like a tag.

- When fetching data from an external source, it is imposible to do it in the logic part of a component
because Next prerenders its code before sending it to the browser.

- The getStaticProps function in Next helps to run asynchronous code but only when the user vists a page that 
requests it and not before the page is loaded like normal.

- It is written above the SFC of a component, where all the imported files are stated. It is exported insted of 
imported.

- Creating a component that displays different information, based on which tab is clicked is done by wrapping the
file name in square brackets so Next understands that this component is a Route Parameter i.e. dynamic path.

- This is necessary because of the pre-rendering nature of Nextjs.

- The getStaticProps helps Next generate routes and html pages for each ids returned in aforementioned function.
